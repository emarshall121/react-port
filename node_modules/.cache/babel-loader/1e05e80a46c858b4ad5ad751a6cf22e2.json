My name is Emily Marshall and I have taken an extremely winding road to get to where I am today. I was born and raised in Michigan. At 18 years old I joined the United States Air Force. During the next 4 years I trained to be an Airborne Russian Linguist and lived all over the United States. Some of those places included Texas, California, Washington, and Nebraska. In 2004 I moved to England where I lived and went to school for two years. After returning to the United States I joined the Air National Guard in Arizona and became a sensor operator on the MQ-1 Predator unmanned airplane. Throughout this time I continued my education. Eventually I got out of the military and began my career in public education. At that time I started teaching 7th and 8th grade math at a middle school near Tucson. Shortly after joining the district I became the go-to person to help teachers who wanted to integrate technology into their classroom. Because of this reputation I was soon offered a position at my school as a Site Technology Coordinator. This position meant that I was in charge of all technology at my school including hardware, software, and the entire network. It was here that I learned that I loved being able to help teachers overcome their insecurities when it came to integrating technology into their class in meaningful ways. I shared my knowledge and enthusiasm with Site Technology Coordinators at other schools. When the district I worked in opened up a brand new position of Education Technology Coordinator I jumped at the opportunity. This position put me in a district level role in which I got to oversee technology education for teachers, our district-wide STEM program, and the overhall and expansion of computer science education for all students. I soon realized that I really enjoyed coding, web development, and the challenges these things brought. This is what led me to the University of Arizona Coding Bootcamp.        \"\n      }, void 0, false, {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 10,\n        columnNumber: 9\n      }, this)\n    }, void 0, false, {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 9,\n      columnNumber: 7\n    }, this)]\n  }, void 0, true, {\n    fileName: _jsxFileName,\n    lineNumber: 6,\n    columnNumber: 5\n  }, this);\n}\n\n_c = About;\nexport default About;\n\nvar _c;\n\n$RefreshReg$(_c, \"About\");","map":{"version":3,"sources":["/Users/emilytest/Desktop/Random/bootcamp/challenges/challenge-20/react-port/src/components/About/index.js"],"names":["React","coverImage","About","width"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAP,MAAkB,OAAlB;AACA,OAAOC,UAAP,MAAuB,sCAAvB;;;AAEA,SAASC,KAAT,GAAiB;AACf,sBACE;AAAS,IAAA,SAAS,EAAC,MAAnB;AAAA,4BACE;AAAI,MAAA,EAAE,EAAC,OAAP;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,YADF,eAEE;AAAK,MAAA,GAAG,EAAED,UAAV;AAAsB,MAAA,SAAS,EAAC,MAAhC;AAAuC,MAAA,KAAK,EAAE;AAAEE,QAAAA,KAAK,EAAE;AAAT,OAA9C;AAAgE,MAAA,GAAG,EAAC;AAApE;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,YAFF,eAGE;AAAK,MAAA,SAAS,EAAC,MAAf;AAAA,6BACE;AAAG,QAAA,KAAK,EAAC,KAAT;AAAe,QAAA,KAAK,EAAE,EAAtB;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AADF;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,YAHF;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,UADF;AAYD;;KAbQD,K;AAeT,eAAeA,KAAf","sourcesContent":["import React from 'react';\nimport coverImage from '../../assets/Emily/emily_website.png';\n\nfunction About() {\n  return (\n    <section className=\"my-5\">\n      <h1 id=\"about\">About Me</h1>\n      <img src={coverImage} className=\"my-2\" style={{ width: \"30%\" }} alt=\"cover\" />\n      <div className=\"my-2\">\n        <p class=\"box\" style={{}}>\n        Privyet!
